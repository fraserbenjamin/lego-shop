# Learn Components with React & LEGO®

![Demo Site](docs/assets/demo-site.png)

## Introduction

This project takes you through the basic concepts of components and how to use them to build applications. You will also learn about React and use it to create a website loosley based on the LEGO® Shop.

## Setup

To help get started quickly, we recommend using [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com), an online code editor that allows you to start developing right away. You can find the project [here](https://stackblitz.com/~/github.com/fraserbenjamin/lego-shop). It provides a solid text editor without having to install anything on your computer. Just click the link and you can start building right away!

If you would like to run the project on your computer, you can clone the project from GitHub and run it locally. To do this, you will need to have Node.js installed on your computer. You can find the project [here](https://nodejs.org/en/). Once you have Node.js installed, you can clone the project from GitHub and run the following commands in the terminal `npm install` and `npm run dev`.

## What are Components?

Components are the building blocks of a React application. They are reusable pieces of code that can be used to build a user interface. Components can be thought of as custom HTML elements that can be used to build a website. They can be used to create complex user interfaces by combining multiple components together.

## Why use Components?

Components are a great way to build a website. They allow you to break down a website into smaller pieces, making it easier to manage and maintain. They also allow you to reuse code, which can save time and reduce the amount of code you need to write. Components are also a great way to build complex user interfaces, as they allow you to break down a website into smaller pieces, making it easier to manage and maintain.

## What's in the box?

Inside the `src` folder, you will find the following items:

- `assets`: This folder contains the images, videos & data files used in the project.

- `components`: This folder contains the individual components used to build the website. This could be everything from a button to a navigation bar.

- `pages`: This folder contains the pages of the website. Each page is made up of multiple components.

- `App.tsx`: This is the main file that contains the structure of the website. It is made up of multiple pages and components. Once you've created a new page or component, you will need to add it to this file to make it appear on the website.

- `main.tsx`: This is the file that renders the website. It is the first file that is run when the website is loaded.

- `index.css`: This file contains the basic styles for the website. We've used it to load in the LEGO® font.

- `types.ts`: This file contains the types used in the project. This is used to define the structure of the data used in the project. See the [TypeScript documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html) for more information.

## Tools

To help you get going quickly we've added some other tools to the project, you don't need to worry about these too much at the moment, but they are there to help you as you progress through the project. You're welcome to explore them if you're interested.

- `react-router-dom`: This is a tool that allows you to create a multi-page website. It allows you to create links between pages and manage the state of the website. Learn more about React Router [here](https://reactrouter.com/).

- `tailwindcss`: This is a tool that allows you to create custom styles for your website. It is a utility-first framework that allows you to quickly style your website without having to write a lot of CSS. Learn more about Tailwind CSS [here](https://tailwindcss.com/).

- `typescript`: This is a superset of JavaScript that allows you to add types to your code, making it easier to manage and maintain. See the [TypeScript documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html) for more information.

- `vite`: This is a tool that allows you to quickly build and run your website. It is a development server that allows you to quickly see the changes you make without having to refresh the page. Learn more about Vite [here](https://vitejs.dev/).
